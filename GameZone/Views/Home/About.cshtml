        <!-- Add brief history of AceZone -->
        <p class="text-center">
            In the early 2000s, three childhood friends with a shared passion for gaming came together with a dream: to create a haven where gamers of all ages could immerse themselves in the thrill and camaraderie that only gaming can offer. AceZone was born out of this shared vision and passion.

            Starting from a small, cozy arcade in a bustling neighborhood, AceZone quickly became the go-to spot for local gamers. The founders, poured their hearts and souls into curating a diverse collection of games and creating a welcoming atmosphere that felt like home.

            Word of mouth spread, and soon, AceZone was buzzing with excitement. </p>
